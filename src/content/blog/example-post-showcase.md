This post is a cheat sheet, not a devlog. It's `draft: true`, so it never shows up on
`/blog`, the homepage carousel, RSS, or the sitemap — but the page itself still builds, so
you can open it directly any time you forget how something works. Delete it whenever you
don't need it anymore.

## Frontmatter fields, what each one does

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
description: "1-2 sentences. Used for SEO <meta description> and social share cards."
excerpt: "Optional. If set, shown on /blog and the homepage carousel INSTEAD of description."
pubDate: 2026-06-23
updatedDate: 2026-06-24 # optional — shows "· updated <date>" next to the date
heroImage: "devlog/my-post/cover.jpg" # optional — path inside your R2 bucket
tags: ["unreal", "gameplay"] # optional, defaults to [] — powers the tag filter on /blog
draft: true # optional, defaults to false — hides from listings, keeps the page buildable
featured: false # optional, defaults to false — true adds it to the homepage carousel
---
```

- **title** — required. Shows as the `<h1>` and the browser tab title.
- **description** — required. This is the SEO/share-card text. Keep it tight, one or two
  sentences.
- **excerpt** — optional. Only set this if you want the `/blog` list and homepage carousel
  to say something *different* from the SEO description. If you skip it, both places just
  show `description`.
- **pubDate** — required. Drives sort order everywhere and the "year" grouping on `/blog`.
- **updatedDate** — optional. Adds a "· updated [date]" next to the publish date.
- **heroImage** — optional. Path *inside your R2 bucket* (not a full URL). When set, it
  shows up in three places automatically: the small thumbnail in this post's header, the
  thumbnail on its `/blog` card and homepage carousel card, and the `og:image`/`twitter:image`
  used when the link gets shared.
- **tags** — optional array. Each one becomes a clickable filter pill in the "Tags" popover
  on `/blog`.
- **draft** — optional. `true` keeps the page buildable (so you can preview it) but hides it
  from `/blog`, the homepage, the RSS feed, and the sitemap.
- **featured** — optional. `true` adds the post to the homepage carousel. Has no effect
  while `draft: true` — drafts never show there regardless.

## Reading time and table of contents — automatic, no field needed

Reading time is computed from word count (~200 words/min) and shown next to the date.

The "On this page" box is the same kind of automatic — nothing to set up, but the rules for
when it shows are specific:

- It's built from every `##` and `###` heading in the post. `#` (the title) doesn't count,
  and anything deeper than `###` is ignored.
- It only appears if the post has **more than one** heading. A single `##` isn't enough to
  bother with a sidebar for.
- It only renders on screens **1440px and wider**. Below that there isn't enough room beside
  the centered content column to show it without squeezing the article, so it just hides —
  the page layout never shifts to make room for it.
- On qualifying screens it's `position: fixed` in the left margin and stays in view as you
  scroll past the heading it's tracking. The currently-visible section is highlighted in the
  sidebar automatically as you scroll.
- The heading anchors it links to (`#what-s-coming`, etc.) are auto-generated from the
  heading text — you don't write or set those either.

If you want a heading to show up here, just use `##`/`###`. If you don't want a heading
included, keep it at `####` or deeper, or don't add a heading at all.

## Basic text formatting

Plain paragraph text. **Bold**, *italic*, ***bold italic***, ~~strikethrough~~, and
`inline code` all work the normal markdown way. You can also drop raw HTML into a
markdown file when you need something markdown doesn't cover, like <mark>a highlighted
span</mark> or pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>.

## Blockquote

> Use blockquotes for pulled quotes, design notes you want to call out, or anything that
> should visually break from the main text.

## Code blocks

Fenced code blocks get syntax highlighting automatically based on the language tag —
no extra setup needed.

```cpp
void AMyCharacter::Jump()
{
    if (CanJump())
    {
        LaunchCharacter(FVector(0, 0, JumpVelocity), false, true);
    }
}
```

```ts
export function clamp(value: number, min: number, max: number): number {
  return Math.min(max, Math.max(min, value));
}
```

## Images, with a caption

Standard markdown image — point it at your R2 bucket path the same way as `heroImage`:

```md
![Alt text describing the image](https://YOUR_R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL/devlog/my-post/screenshot.jpg)
```

If you want a caption under the image, drop to raw HTML for that one image:

```html
<figure>
  <img src="https://YOUR_R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL/devlog/my-post/screenshot.jpg" alt="Describe it" />
  <figcaption>Optional caption text shown under the image.</figcaption>
</figure>
```

## Collapsible section

Handy for spoilers, long logs, or optional detail you don't want taking up space by default:

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

Anything indented here only shows once expanded — works with any markdown inside, including
more code blocks or lists.

</details>

That's everything. Copy this file, strip what you don't need, and start writing.
